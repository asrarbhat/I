 Lecture 1:
    A human history, before there were any written records, based on scientific evidence.
    It describes over 2.5 million years of human past.
    It actually begins 6 million years ago, with our origin among the apes in eastern africa.
    The story is still incomplete.
    Radio-carbon dating revolutionezed it, after world war 2.

    Sources of prehistory:
        Archaelogy
        Oral history 
        Incomplete written records of earliest civilizations.
        Biology
        Zoology
        and other scienctific sources 

    This is based on science, and not based on religion.
    Modern humans came from africa.
    primate: a mammal of an order that includes monkeys, apes, and humans etc. They are distinguished by having hands, feet that are simliar to hands, and foward-facing eyes, and are typically agile tree-dwellers.
    mammal: a warm-blooded vertebrate animal of class that is distinguished by the possesion of hair or fur, females that secrete milk for nourishment of the young, and typically give birth of the live young.
    vertebrate: an animal of a large group distinguished by the possesion of backbone or spinal column, including mammals, birds,reptiles, amphibians and fishes.
    
    Humans: Domain(Eukarya) > kingdom (Animalia: organisms that move) > Phylum (Chordata: with backbone) > Class (Mammalia) > Order (Primates)> Family (Hominidae: flat faces and three dimentional vision)>Genus (homo: upright posture and large brains)>Species(sapiens: high forehead and thin skull bones)

    warm blooded vs cold blooded: our body attempts to maintain our body temperature regardless of outside temperature. Cold blooded animals cannot regulate their internal body temperature according to that of changing environment. They find it diffcult to survive the extreme temperature conditions, eg reptiles and fish. Their body temperature is nearly same as that of its surrounding. They can't generate their own heat. Warm blooded animals can regulate and maintain a constant internal temperature of the body, But they need food to do so.
    Modern humans are homo sapiens sapiens, we are subspecies from 160000 years, and homo sapiens are from 300000 years.
    
Lecture 2: In the beginning.
    there are primates: two orders of that would be Anthropoids and Prosimians(Lemurs(Apes,humans,monkeys),Tarsiers(other Premonkeys))
    We and the chimpanzee's have the common ancestor. They are our closest to us, we separeted some 5,6 million years ago.
    they had to stand upright in the african savanna's to survive, bipedal posture. When africa become dry and savanna's become something, being pedal helped to keep track of predators and it freed the hands which now could be used to make tools.
    because of savanna's they could no longer find food just from the trees, they had to go out of trees and they had to now run, and survive on ground as well.
    And because it was hard to get food, they started to eat meat as well and at the same time became more and more mobile.
    They are called the Hominids.
    The fossil records for this period is very rare.
    human evolutin was not linear, it was bush like, one of which lead to us.
    lucy is the most famous hominid, in 1970's from 3.8 million years ago and about 4 feet tall.
    as the hominids evolved, so did their brain size. It could be because of eating more meat.
