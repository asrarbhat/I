singers need to train, and they need to practise.
don't watch whole course and then start training.
train for 30 to 120 minutes a day.
9 out of 10 people can sing with training.
if you train, you will get better at it.
singing is an athletic endevour. It is mostly about building motor skills.

the language of vocal training:
    bridging:
        to bridge means to sing from the chest then to vocal cords and then via mouth seemlessly, without pushing, or choking or any kind of instability, back and forth. Usually there is instability near the vocal break in your throat. It should feel like one connecting voice. In technical terms it is called passajo(passage in time)

    connecting:
        once you are in your head after bridging, your voice should not be weak, it should be strong.
    
    brigding and connecting go hand in hand.
    to have these means you have range, where connecting is for high notes, high notes add thrill to the scene.

    Falsetto is NOT your head voice:
        different vocal modes:
            speech, sobbing(lower of larynx), opera (low rich sound), belt (high chest voice notes), twang (quank like a duck)
