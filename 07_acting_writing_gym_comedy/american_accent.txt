series of 5 lectures:
    grammar is systematic, accent is free form and intuitive.
    it is just a matter of learning.
    word stress conveys meaning.
    accent != pronunciation
    you don't say the word, as the way it is written.
    better is beder, listen is lisen, business is biznis, pool is pwool, feel is fyeel.
    you need to be conscious about what you say initially.

intonation:
    americans don't really move lips.
    most sounds in throat using tongue actively.
    intonation: speech music, the flow, it indicates mood.
    do not speak word by word, you end up sounding mechanical and foreign.
    connect words to form sound groups.
    think of sound units instead of words.
    bob is on a phone, bobis ona phone.
    vowels are stretched, no is noooo.
