Steve Martin's Masterclass:
    know that there is room for you out there in the world, and you don't need to have special gift.
    be where the comedy is, because when it is your turn to be picked, you need to be at pointing distance.
    you gotta put yourself in position so you can be chosen.
    Be so good that they can't ignore you.
    Talk about, what hasn't been talked about, and there is always a new thing to talk about out there as the world is changing.
    think about comedy all the time. Always think about the joke.
    to gather the material, educate yourself, become informed and intelligent, learn about things, you get a greater vocabalary. Learning history etc.
    Material is everywhere. A million things happen to you everyday and you can make value out of it.
    Mine your friends for material.
    Think what does the society need right now, what needs to be discussed that is not being discussed. People dig that.
    Ask yourself, what is the state of the nation, find a whole that the climate of the nation has, that the climate of the nation has or even your community.
    say something that is in everyone's mind.
