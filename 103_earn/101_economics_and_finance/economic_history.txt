    before 1800, the living standard didn't increase that much, and then we had industrial revolution, and it increased very much, and it has been increasing very fast. That is income per capita is increasing say 1-2% per year.

    But there are economies that have gone poorer, those are ones in sub-saharan africa.
    the era till 1800 is called malthosian era.
    then we had industrial revolution.
    and now we have divergence, that is the gap between rich and poor is increasing.

    industrial revolution is the greatest event in last 100000 years for humans.
    in fact events like great depressions don't matter in this scale, and things keep going up.

    NEOLITHIC revolution: 10,000 - 5000BC : going from hunter gatherers to an agricultural society.
                          it was not good enough to leave malthosian trap.
                          there was technological advancement, but not good enough.
    
    Commercial revolution: 1200 - 1700
                          long distance trades, commercial markets and systems.
    
    protestant reformation: 1517 - 1648
                          not that good, like by martin luther king.
                          they were amazing but of not much effect.
    
    Scientific revolution: 1543 - 1700
                           it doesn't do much also.
    
    Industrious revolution: 1600 - 1800
                           this was remarkable, and changed the world,
                           focus shifted from leisure to work.
                           hunter gatherers only worked for 6 hours, and we work more.
                           it is ironic, but we now work more.
                           we learned to love work.
                           now you have more stuff to spend your income on, hence you start to earn more.
                           this was before industrial revolution.
    
    Democratic Revolution:
                           high income societies tend to be Democratic societies.
                           before this king would make all decisions, and parliament would try to maximize money for the king.

    Democraphic revolution: 1870-1920
                           in pre-industrial rich people choose to have more children.
                           now rich people give birth to less children, now people didn't want more humans with their money, they wanted to consume new cool stuff.

    property rights was also one of the biggest revolution in pre industrial revolution era.

lecture2: The logic of the Malthusian
    it describes whole history till industrial revolution, when it comes to economics.
    science lies under the industrial revolution albeit.
    people won't want to earn more if there aren't much of the consumption possibilities.
    
    ofcourse, pre industrial revolution events set the foundation for industrial revolution to happen.
    own idea: the risk of some king coming over and burning down everything and which would lead to fall of hundreds of years of advancement also reduced over time and it helped.

    before 1800: births have to equal death, an average women had 2 surving children. On average 3 would die and 2 would survive. To have stable society and match the resources.

    people at the eve of industrial revolution were no better than hunter gatherers.

    three assumptions:
        1. Birthrate increases when income increase, turns out it was true, rich people had more children than poor children in pre- industrial societies.
        2. Death rate declines as income increases. you would have clean water, you live in comformtable life etc.
        3. income would go down when population increases: because there is limit to production, like land, labour, capital, energy was limited like wood, same for clothing from wool, so much so that human waste was used to increase output per acre. and the marginal product of labour diminshes.
