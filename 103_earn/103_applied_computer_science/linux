once done,you can call yourself linux systems admin/engineer.

introduction:
    a linux distribution/disto is an operating system made from a software collection that is upon the linux kernel and often a package management systems

    the linux OS has:
        linux kernel  //latest 5.7.10  //kernel.org
        GNU shell utilities  //all shell commands
        graphical destop enviroment etc.

    there are hundreds of distributions,for different purposes.
        redhat,centos,ubuntu power the servers on internet.
        linux mint for pc 
        openWrt for embedded systems
        raspberry pi for arm cpu's 

        distrowatch.com for distribution related details.

    in industry most use ubuntu and redhat.

    banks use redhat etc,but it is not free.
    redhat was acquired by ibm in july

    centos is free and based on redhat,it is basically redhat without branding or support.

    ubuntu is free, and used by startups etc

    kali linux and hundreds of security tools so it is used for ethical hacking etc.

    you can use vmware or virtual box,but virtual box is free and vmware is not
    hardware requirements for ubuntu:
        atleast 2gb of ram
        and 20gb of disk.

    file installing virtual box also install extention pack,for camera usb etc to support.
    ubuntu means "humanity towards others"

    latest ubuntu uses gnome shell as a default graphical interface.
    xubuntu and lubuntu are ubuntu's with different graphical interaface.

    LTS version of ubuntu: LONG TERM SUPPORT,which means five years of support.
    latest ubuntu 20.04 is only availabe for 64bit architecture.

    ubuntu comes with bi annual releases with one coming and april and another in october.

    version names 20.04 year.month

    ubuntu is about 2.5 gbs

    you need to enable virtualization in bios,if error.

    ping ipaddress to check internet connection
    and ping localhost to see if your network card is working.


    after installing ubuntu,update all softwares to upto date.
        sudo apt update updates the repository db 
        sudo apt full-update will update all apps to latest versions.
    
    cd etc are mounted at /media/user/cdname

    reboot in bash to reboot the system.

    you can create a snapshot of os in virtualbox.to restart from there.and if you are going to do something dangerous,take a snapshort first,in case it breaks the system.

    you can restore a snapshut only when machine is not running.
        click on restore to restore it.

    mirror servers act like backup servers.

    centOS 8 is new centOS 

    virtual box is by Oracle.

    windows key is called super key in linux.
    
    dock is the place like your panel.


THE LINUX TERMINAL IN DEPTH:
----------------------------
    linux is highly oriented around commands,even though it has gui also.
    there are hundreds of highly efficient commands.

    terminal<> terminal emulator,it allows you to access the system through a shell.
    
    A shell is a program that takes commands from the user and gives them to the os's kernal to execute.
    it is also called the command interpreter,it takes commands and checks if they are syntactically correct.The shell gets started when the user logs in or starts the terminal . gnome terminal is deafult in ubuntu,other like terminator etc. terminal is a gui program.

    each tab in terminal starts a new shell.

    ctrl+alt+t to open it.

    ip addr
        to see the ip address
    
    there are several shells,but most used is bash,even mac uses it.
        there are other shells like bourne shell korn shell c shell etc.
    
    console: 
        a special terminal that starts if no gui is available.
        it is a text only interface.
        started in an environment where there is no gui.
        may times terminal and console are used interchangbly

    linux is case senstive opeartiong system.


    sudo apt update &&  sudo apt install terminator
        to install terminator terminal.
        now its icon would be in one of the apps,it is also a gui app.
    
    in terminator:
        right click and you can split horizontally or vertically.

    ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
         to check network connectivity, -c 1 to send 1 packet.
         8.8.8.8 is public dns server by google.
         ping 127.0.0.1 is your loopback address and if it works your device is fine.
    
    for a command:
        there are argumets and options separeted by space.
        options are prefixed by hyphen
        you can use as many whitespaces as you want.
        it is insensitive to mulitple spaces.
        like ping     -c    1    127.0.0.1
        it is often the case that command options come before the arguments but there are other variations as well.
        eg ping 127.0.0.1 -c 1

        but better use options before arguments.

        some commands return an error code if it fails,and some might even show textual version.

        ls to list all files in current diretory
        ls -l for long list 
        ls -l /etc for it

        can use double hyphen and whole word
        ls --all   or ls -a it shows also hidden files.

        ls -l -all 
        can group short hands together like ls -alh
        
        df commands to display info about file system and disk space.

    
    man pages:
        manual pages for commands for help.
        it is like a documentation for command.
        man commandname
        man ls

        in man page synopsis
        ls [option]... [file]... ellipses here means you can have multiple files and options
        [] anything inside them,means they are optional.


        bold text means use as it is and underlined is placeholder and you need to put appropriate value.

        you can use arrow keys to go up and down.
        space to forward by one window
         ctrl+b to go back by one window.

         G to end and g for begining

         to search got to begining and write /string to search for and enter.matches will be highlighed and you can navigate between matches using n 

         1 to escape.

    there are two types of commands,c programs and inbuilt shell commands.

    type ls to check what kind of command it is
    executables are in /usr/bin/

    help cd  to seek help for it as it is a shell command and there is no man page.

    help doesn't work for executable commands.

    command --help is availabe on both
    ls --help

    ifconfig to see network interfaces realated information.

    sudo apt install net-tools
    as ifconfig is part of net-tools.

    to search something in all man pages.
        man -k ifconfig
        man -k uname
        man -k "copy files"

        and it will find all such commands.
        it is same as 

                apropos uname 
                apropos "copy files"
        
    
    being efficient using tab key for autocompletion:
        it helps you to not make mistakes as you might spell working
        cat /etc/passwd ,it would show all text in terminal.

        if tab doesn't autocomplete there might be an error.

        eg rm /var/log/ abc.txt i will remove both which is devastating.
    
    keyboard shortcuts:
        ctrl+l to clear the screen.
        same as clear

        ctrl+d or exit to exit the shell.

        ctrl+a moves curser to begining of line.

        up down arrows to traverse histoy.

        ctrl+e to go to end of line.
        ctrl+u cut and copy whole line.
        ctrl+c to kill a process.
        ctrl+z to pause it
            to resume bg %1
        
    bash command history:
        cat .bash_history
        how many commands it saves is controlled by env variable HISTFILESIZE
        echo $HISTFILESIZE
            it saves 2000 by default.
        
        history , to see the some of history
        env variable HISTSIZE contols how many it shows,hence how many in memory.
        
        to run a command from history
        !123 ,where 123 is the command number
        !! to run the last command,same as top arrow.
        ! -7 to run 7th from bottom.

        !ping to excute last ping command.

        !ping:p it would print last ping command executed.

        to search commands already done
            ctrl+R and while you enter letter it finds the related commands.
        
        and then press enter to write that command

        history -d 102 to delete that command from history.
        to clear whole history           history -c 

    to run a command without having it in history:
        wget to download a file.

        possible solutions:
            add a space before the command and now it is not added to history.
            to make it work:
            env variable HISTCONTROL is set, values     ignoreboth,ignoredups.
            set it to ignoreboth, dups means duplicates,good to set to ignoreboth.
            so if you run same command multiple times it won't be added to history.
        
        add to .bashrc.
            echo "HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth">>~/.bashrc
        
        to save command hisotry with time stamp:
            set env variable HISTTIMEFORMAT, set it to  "%d/%m/%y %T " T is the time
    getting root access:
         there are two types of users:
            root and non-privilaged.
            root is also called super user,or administrator.
    
        there is only one root.
        don't do things as root.
        to get to super user
        use sudo su
            super user do substitute user.
            the password to enter is yours.
            you need to be in sudo group in ubuntu and wheel in centos for it.
            you temporary become the root.
        id command prints user and groups it belongs to.

        roots prompt ends with #

        sudo command to execute that command as super user.

        only root can add to a group and create groups.

        sudo useradd john
        sudo caches password for 5 minutes.
        sudo -k so that from now on password will be required.

        to change passwd, passwd command
        sudo passwd root

        su to switch user.

        password should be longer than or equal to 8 characters.

        root directory /
        /root is root users home directory.

        for other users is in /home

LINUX FILE SYSTEM:
------------------
a file system controls how data is stored and retrieved.
each group of data is called a file.and the structur and the logic rules used to manage files and their names are called file systems.
a file system is a logical collection of files on a paritition or disk.
on linux systems everything is a file.
on linux file names and directory names are case sensitive.

    the structure of a file system on linux is hierarchical

                                            /
    /bin    /boot   /dev    /home   /lib    /media  /mnt    /options    /proc   /root   /sbin   /srv    /sys    /tem    /usr    /var    

    under /var are /vache /lib /log /mail /spool /tmp 
    under /usr are /bin /include /lib /local /sbin /src 
    
    directory and folder are interchangeable.

    in linux all directories come under root even if saved under different partitions,where as that is not the case with windows.

    even the usbs are mounted under root,it is mounted to a directory called mount point.
    df -h to see all partitions etc
    usb is usually mounted in /media/ you can access it there.

    /bin contains binaries like ls for user to execute
    /sbin contians binaries that only superuser can use hence s in name eg fdisk etc
    /boot container files required to boot the system.
    /home for users home directory,inside it will be names of directories same as that of the name of user.
    /root is root users home directory.

    /dev contains device files,for every hardware attached to the system,and contains everything needed to access that hardware.

    eg /dev/sda1 is the first partition of hardisk.

    /etc is editable text configurations,it contains all configurations eg users,passwords,nginx etc.

    /lib contains libraries,package manager can put things here during installation of things.

    /media contains external storage.
    /mnt was used for cd roms etc 
    /tmp container temporary files like applications and files open.
    /proc contains your hardware info,kernel etc
        eg cat /proc/cpuinfo
                cat /proc/meminfo
    /sys contains info about drivers
    /srv contains data for servers.

    /bin and /sbin are symlinks to /usr/bin and /usr/sbin

    /var contains variable length files like logs etc
        cat /var/log/auth.log contains all login attempts.
    

    filesystem heierarchy standard is a standard about what should be in / and what they mean.


    working in filesystem:
        cd,ls,pwd
        path is a location to a file or a directory.
            can be absolute or relative.
        
        tree or tree /var it lists like a tree which is cool.
    
        tree -d for only directories and -f for full abosolute paths.

        tree -f >> fs.txt is a cool way to copy the whoe structure of file system into a file.

    ls -1 for one file per line.
        -l for long listing.
            d for directory - for file ,l for link,next line for permissions of user,group,other,also last modified time.
        -h for size in human readable format
        ls -S for sorting in size.
    
    to find size of a directory:
        du -sh /etc/
    ls -r for recursive listing.

    file time stamps:
        the access timestamp atime is the last time the file was read ls -lu
        the modifeid timestamp mtime is the last time contents of the file was modified ls -l,ls -lt 
        the changed timestamp ctime is the last time when some metadata related to the file was changed
        ls -lc 
        time is from epoch from 1970 in seconds.

        stat /etc/passwd for whole thing to see.
        all kind of data,even last access 
        change time eg when permissions were changed like last time.

        to change the time stamp on a file.
            don't use whitespaces for file name in linux,or use "" to do so better use hypen or underscore.
            touch -a linux.txt for access time
            touch -m linux.txt for modifcation time 
            or to set manually 
                touch -m -t 201812301530.45 linux.txt

    date to see current time.
    by default ls sorts by name
    ls -lt to sort by modification time.
    ls -ltu by access time and shows access time.
    ls -ltr by reverse and time.
