Human voice is a powerful instrument that we play.
There are a few habits that we need to move away from:
    Don't gossip or speak ill of someone.
    Don't judge.
    Don't be negative.
    Don't Complain.
    Don't give excuses.
    Don't exegerate and lie, it would result in lying.
    Don't confuse facts with opinions.

What to do:
    HAIL
    Honesty: be clear and straight.
    Authenticity: be yourself, stand in your truth.
    Integrity: be your word.
    Love: wish them well.

your voice should be rich, smooth, like a chocolate. Do breathing exercises, and work on your voice.
Don't have a single tone or don't be monotonous.
speak from your throat.
your pace should be nice. Slow when needed.
Don't fill silences with hmm's and aah's 
pitch also helps, and same for volume.
warm up your voice.
    make your tongue, lips, throat, cheeks alive before speaking.
