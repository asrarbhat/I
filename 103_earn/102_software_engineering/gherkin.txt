This is a horrible way of writing tests, as And are action things, it doesn't tell us what we see it just says what we do.
Hence every action should have a check to see if it is sucessful.

Scenario: Search a product
Given the user is on homepage
When the user searches for "chair"
Then the "chair" product page should display

break your file into Scenario's
like for search, add to basket etc.

gherkin is not about writing every click, it is about having a readable file.

Given: precondition ro setup (must be first)
When: Action 
Then: Assertion
And, But: wild cards (they match the keyword above them)
But: Generally negative assertion (rarely used)

Given I login as "user1"
When I navigate to the "account" page
And I click on "sign out" on the "account" page
Then the "home page" should be displayed 

And after When would have action, and And after Then should have assertion.

You can use 
Given, When, And, Then, When, And, Then, And and so on that way.

 You can't put an Action And after an Assertion you have to use When.

 don't be too descriptive.
 your step should be less than 100 characters.
 regex play a role.
 make sure there is no ambiguity, and be specific.

 every Scenario should be independent to run.
 Don't be imperative, be Declarative, but don't be too vague, better be somewhere in the middle.
 your line should be resusable.
 use parameters.
 # for comments, and can only comment on a whole line.
 can use both spaces and tabs for indentation.
 Feature:
