introduction:
    building java application with spring and hibernate.
    these are most popular frameworks in java.

spring overview:
    for enterprise java applications.
    similar to j2EE.
    we had servlets and jsp in 1999 in j2EE.
    J2EE had beans also.
    but j2ee was too tedious and error prone, and poor performance.
    hence we got spring finally.
    we got spring in 2004, and spring 4.3 in 2016.
    spring is most sought after java skill set by employers.
    you can learn spring or you can learn java EE or you can learn both.
    better learn both, they are similar.
    spring 5 was released in 2017
        they upgraded java requirements to java 8 or more.
        and MVC now use servlet api4.0
    this will cover mostly spring 4.
    official website: www.spring.io 
    think of java EE has another framework like spring.
    spring simplifies java enterprise development.
    goals of spring:
        lightweight development with java POJOs (plain old java objects)
        dependency injection to promote loose coupling.
        declarative programming with Aspect-Oriented-programming(AOP)
        minimize boilerplate java code.

    core containers:
        beans, core, spEL, Context.
        core container is the main thing in spring.
        factory for creating beans.
        manage bean dependencies.
    
    infrastructre:
        AOP, Aspects, instrumentation, messaging.
    
    Data Acess Layer:
        to communicate with database.
        it has jdbc, orm(object relational model to access database like jpa etc ), transactions, oxm, jms.
    
    web layer:
        servlet, websocket, web, portiet.
        for mvc.
    
    test layer:
        unit, integration, mock 

    spring projects:
        add ons on top of spring,
        spring cloud for cloud, etc even there is spring for andriod.
    

setting up development environment:
    spring5 requires java 8 or higher.
    java application server: tomcat
    ide: eclipse.
    
    tomcat 10 was released in 2002.
    tomcat9 works with spring5.
    download tomcat.
    tomcat runs on 8080 by default.
    and tomcat would run as a service at port 8080.
    downlaod eclipse for EE.
    you can connect your tomcat to your eclipse for easy deployment of applications from your eclipse.
    click on servers in the bottom and add tomcat 9.
    you can manually download spring jar files or use maven.
    create a java project in eclipse, don't create any module, create a new folder named lib in your project, go to spring go to artifacts and download spring recent dist.zip and copy all jar files from libs and paste in your lib folder. and add jar files to java build path in properties and java build path and then click on classpath and click on add jar and select all jar files.

spring inversion of control:
    IoC: the approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects, and object factory handles objects.
    create a new package in your src eg com.abc.spring
    create classes in it.
    POJO: plain old java object. //normal kind of java.
    to be configurable means to have to make a change at configuration file and everything is done underneath. Interface gives us some kind of polymorphism.
    but in spring we have object factory, and we use configuration files to do our tasks, eg what implementation of interface we would use would be decided by configuration file, instead of us creating the object of specific implementation.

    Spring container:
        primary function:
            create and manage objects (inversion of control)
            inject object's dependencies(Dependency injection)
        configuring spring container:
            XML configuration file (legacy, but most legacy apps still use it)
            Java Annotation (modern)
            Java Source Code (modern)

            we will cover all three.
    
    Spring development process:
        configure your spring beans.
        create a spring container.
        retrieve beans from spring container.
    
        step1: configure your spring bean:
            <beans ...>
                <bean id="myCoach" class="com.abc.BaseballCoach">
            </beans>
        step2: create a spring container:
            spring container is generally known as ApplicationContext 
            Specialized implementation:
                ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
                AnnotationConfigApplicatonContext
                GenericWebApplicationContext
                others...
            
            ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");

        step3: Retrieve Beans from container by our application.
    
            Coach theCoach = context.getBean("myCoach", coach.class);
                here myCoach relates to the bean id and Coach.class is the name of the interface that BaseeballCoach implements.
        
    what is spring bean:
        a spring bean is a java object. When java objets are created by the spring container then spring refers to them as spring beans. they are created from normal java classes.
    
    in src paste applicationContext.xml 
        in it you define your beans:
            <bean id= "myCoach" class="com.company.CricketCoach"> </bean>
    
        within the package in your src, create a HelloSpringApp class with main method.

        public static void main(String[] args){

            //load the spring configuartion file 
            ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context=new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml"); //it could have been any name for configuration file. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext must be imported first.

            //retrieve bean from spring contaniner.
                Coach theCoach=context.getBean("myCoach",Coach.class); //here Coach is the interface.
                System.out.println(theCoach.getDailyWorkout);
            //call methods of the bean 
            //close the context
            context.close(); //to do the cleanup.
        }

        now run it as java application.
        now to configure, all you have to do is change the class to BaseballCoach in configuration file, we made no changes to code, which is amazing.
        

spring dependency injection:
    the client delegates the calls to another object the respoinsibility of prividing its dependencies.
    spring has object factory that has xml configuration file and it would provide the objects.
    there is constructor injection and setter injection.
    lets say you have an interface of a dependency and a few implementations.
    create a constructor that takes object of the interface type and set it to your object.
    create a bean in xml.
    to inject it to your object we put instead <bean of object that takes dependencies> <constructor-arg ref="myFortuneService"(id of dependency bean) /> </bean>
    now when spring reads your xml it creates objects for all beans and wherever you ask it also injects dependencies.
    #amazing.
    the name of the objects created by spring framework is same as the id you provide.
    class in xml has to be full package name till class.
    the java creates default constructor only if there isn't any, if you create one with paramter, java doesn't create one without parameters.
    you set using setter injection:
        in <bean> put <property name="fortuneService" ref..same/>
        it looks for setFortuneService.
    
    injecting literal values:
        <property name=.... value='3' /> 
    to read these things from a properties file instead of hardcoding in xml file.
    create abc.properties 
        foo.email=abc@d.com 
        load properite file to xml 
        <context:property-placeholder location='classpath:abc.properties"/>
        now use value="${foo.email}"


spring bean scopes and lifecycle:
    scopes refer to lifecycle of a bean 
    how long does the bean live.
    how many instances would be created, and how would it be shared.
    default scope is singleton:
        spring container creates only one instanc eof the bean by default and it is cached in memory, all requested would be shared reference to the same bean.
        hence if you use same context anywhere, changes reflect.
        <bean scope='singleton" ... 
    
        proptype scope: create new bean for each request even though container/context is same.
        request: scoped to a http web request.
        session: for http session.
        global-session: scoped for global http web session only for web apps.
    singleton is best as less beans are created.

    Bean Lifecycle:
        container started ---> Bean Instantiated ----> dependencies injected ----> Internal Spring Processing -----> YOur custom Init method--->your application runs ------->your custom destory method ------>stop

        you can add custom code during bean intialization.
        calling custom business logic methods.
        setting up handles to resources(db, sockets, file etc)

        you can add custom code during bean destruction
        calling custom business logic method.
        clean up handles to resources like db, sockets, files etc

        in <bean add init-method="doMyStartUpStuff"> same for destroy-method="whatever" 
        these methods cannot take any arugment they can have any access modifer and they can return anything.

        these methods are within the class.
        these are life cycle methods of beans also called hooks.
         
        for prototype scoped beans, spring does not call the destroy method,it just hands over object and doesn't care what happens to it. you have to do cleanup on your own applies to annotatins as well.
