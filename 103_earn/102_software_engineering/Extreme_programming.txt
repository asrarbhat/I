it was one of the first Agile method.
it is for medium to small size teams.
agile is like keep firing the canon balls until you hit the target and waterfall is like shooting once after careful deliberation.
you try and see where you go: incremental
you build something small and simple and then add next important thing and slowly you reach the goal.
you do small knowing that you would have to refactor your existing solution.
you must not be frightned by rafactoring.
unit test: as you build you keep adding unit tests, and after you refactor you add new tests and you test on old and new test case hence you end up building a test bank.
there are user stories.
there is pair programming.
continuous delivery.
test first.
pair progrmaming: two people working on single code, you keep switching pairs.
there is no single person on whom the team depends this way.
mobbing: even more than 2 people writing single code, driver writes the code, and everyone gets to be a driver for a while.
this way you don't need code review as the code is written by shared people.

test-first: you always write tests, even you write tests first, and these tests are usually written before code.

continuous delivery: you code is always ready to be delivered.

hence you get continuous release.
