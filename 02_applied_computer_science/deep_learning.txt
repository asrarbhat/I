one fourth labs:
----------------
accracy is (tp+tn)/(tp+fp+tn+fn)
precison is tp/(tp+fp)   ==    
recall is tp(tp+fn)      ==    true positives/actual no of postives 
there are four boxes in confusion matrix. tp,fp,fn,tn 
precison : how many selected(positive) items are relavant.(what fraction of selected positives are correct )eg applying brake and dog was there.
recall : how many relavant items are selected.(what fraction of actual positives were selected).

accuracy gives us data, but we want to know more, like how our model feels about positives and negatives.
these metrics are related to binary classification.
type I errror: false positives.
type II error: false negatives. 

confusion matrix is a 2x2 matrix of True false on x axis are actual results, and True false on Y axis are predicted.
                            Actual 
                    True           False 
               
                True 
    predicted
               False 


precision is accuracy among gusssed positives.
recall is accuracy among real positves.

f1 score= 2* precison * recall /(precison +recall)
