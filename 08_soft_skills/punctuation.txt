    comma (,)
        1. to separate items in a list.
            we need to buy milk,eggs,flour and sugar for the cake.
            the job of comma is to show these pauses.we pause after reading each name in the list.
            you can include or not the comma before the and like eggs,flour, and something else.
            if you only have two items use and and avoid using ,
            if more than 2 items are there,put comma after every item except the last and use and before the last item.
            there is no space before , but one after it.

            the list could be verb phrases.

        4. Clauses : independent clause: complete sentence,dependent clause is one that is not complete sentence.
                eg. When Rahul gets home from work is a dependent clause.
                When Rahul gets home from work, he watches TV for an hour.
                hence we use comma after a dependent clause/subordinate clause.
                even if you use two independent sentences in a sentence you must put a comma after first one eg. They offered him a promotion, and he accepted it immediately. you also use a conjuction here as well,and the conjuction is necessary to connect two indepent clauses.

                if the independent clause comes first then you don't use comma, eg I was so happy when I heard the news!
                you don't use comma with essential relative clause also e.g That lady is the scientist who won the Nobel this year.
                you use comma with non essential realtive clauses. eg People love to celebrate New Year's Eve,which is the last day of the year.
                you can have more than 2 clauses in a sentence.

    semicolon(;)
        used to combine closely related sentences
        instead of using having a new sentence we can use conjuction and a comma or separate using ;
        eg. I went to see a movie with my wife. I thought it was amazing,but she thought it was terrible. or use I thought it was amazing; she thoguht it was terrible.
        we can also use however,in fact etc.
        ; makes whole thing a one sentence.

    colon (:)
        Lists 
        it introduces new information after an independent clause.
