it started from a single point that exploded that is what we call big bang, it has infinite temperature and infinite density. It happened 13.8 billion years ago.
time 10 to the power -43 is called plancks time, below it laws of physicis fail, hence we cannot know what happened before that. The size of universe was 10^-35 meters and the temperature was 10^32 K. After plancks time the force of gravity starts to separate from other fundamental forces, matter and antimatter are formed.

Time 10^-35 is when inflation begins, extremely rapid exponential expansion occurs, temperature is around 10^28K.
time 10^-33 inflation stops, T=10^28, A small difference between the reaction rates of matter and antimatter leads to a mix of about 100,000,001 protons for every 100,000,000 antiprotons.
0.0001 s: Antiprotons annilate protons and produce large number of photons, and matter dominates antimatter and universe further cools and expands.
100s: Helium is produced. temperature is 1 billion k.
200 million years: H and He combine to form first stars, after that first supernovae explode spreading carbon,nitrogen, iron, oxygen etc throughout the universe. Then galaxies are formed and then galaxy clusters.
9.1 billion years later: solar system and earth.
13.7 billion years and we are here.
radius of universe is 46 billion light years.
10^80 atoms in the universe.
mass of earth 10^24 kilograms, for sun it is of the order 30. radius of earth is 6400 kilometers, distance between sun and moon is 384,400 kms, from earth to sun it is 150 million kms. earth to mars it is 50 million kms. radius of mars is 3389 kms
earth's tilt is 23.5 degrees, called obliguity of the elliptic
