 Lecture 1:
    A human history, before there were any written records, based on scientific evidence.
    It describes over 2.5 million years of human past.
    It actually begins 6 million years ago, with our origin among the apes in eastern africa.
    The story is still incomplete.
    Radio-carbon dating revolutionezed it, after world war 2.

    Sources of prehistory:
        Archaelogy
        Oral history 
        Incomplete written records of earliest civilizations.
        Biology
        Zoology
        and other scienctific sources 

    This is based on science, and not based on religion.
    Modern humans came from africa.
    primate: a mammal of an order that includes monkeys, apes, and humans etc. They are distinguished by having hands, feet that are simliar to hands, and foward-facing eyes, and are typically agile tree-dwellers.
    mammal: a warm-blooded vertebrate animal of class that is distinguished by the possesion of hair or fur, females that secrete milk for nourishment of the young, and typically give birth of the live young.
    vertebrate: an animal of a large group distinguished by the possesion of backbone or spinal column, including mammals, birds,reptiles, amphibians and fishes.
    
    Humans: Domain(Eukarya) > kingdom (Animalia: organisms that move) > Phylum (Chordata: with backbone) > Class (Mammalia) > Order (Primates)> Family (Hominidae: flat faces and three dimentional vision)>Genus (homo: upright posture and large brains)>Species(sapiens: high forehead and thin skull bones)

    warm blooded vs cold blooded: our body attempts to maintain our body temperature regardless of outside temperature. Cold blooded animals cannot regulate their internal body temperature according to that of changing environment. They find it diffcult to survive the extreme temperature conditions, eg reptiles and fish. Their body temperature is nearly same as that of its surrounding. They can't generate their own heat. Warm blooded animals can regulate and maintain a constant internal temperature of the body, But they need food to do so.
    Modern humans are homo sapiens sapiens, we are subspecies from 160000 years, and homo sapiens are from 300000 years.
