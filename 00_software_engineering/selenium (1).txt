selenium is to testing suite for web based applications.

driver sits between our program and browser.

same origin policy was issue initially when selenium was designed. So they came with a server in selenium RC to trick browser. 

Selenium  web driver removed server and directly interacted with browser from OS level.

selenium IDE is like you do it first andnit gets recorded and you can play same again. you can convert recorded script into java, but it is not recommended.

you don't need server in webdriver. it works at OS level.

download selenium webdriver jars, add all these jars to your buildpath, and do the same for drivers.
